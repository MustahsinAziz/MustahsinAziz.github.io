                <p class="project-text">
                    This research examines the impact of greenspaces on labor productivity using a national dataset of 3,007 U.S. counties from 2010 to 2019. Utilizing NDVI values to measure greenery and GDP per worker as a productivity metric, the study employs a two-way fixed effects panel estimation, with historical land cover data as an instrumental variable. The findings show that a one-unit increase in greenspace significantly boosts productivity by approximately $238,000, supporting previous literature on the benefits of greenery. Unlike prior research, which focused on micro-level office settings or specific regions, this study provides a broader perspective, demonstrating how urban greenspaces can enhance productivity on a national and international scale. The results have significant implications for urban planning, suggesting that investing in greener environments could foster economic growth. Future research will refine the methodology, explore regional differences, and investigate potential nonlinear effects to further validate these findings.

                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="project-text">
                    Agricultural runoff, primarily driven by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs, presents a major threat to the quality of freshwater resources. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports widespread nutrient impairment, with approximately 15,000 water bodies affected by nutrient pollution. Upstream agricultural practices, such as excessive fertilizer use, play a critical role in degrading downstream water quality, impacting ecosystems and increasing treatment costs for drinking water facilities. This study aims to examine the extent to which agricultural runoff contributes to violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) in downstream Community Water Systems (CWS). Leveraging comprehensive EPA data on CWS compliance and detailed agricultural records from the USDA, we employ spatial regression models and GIS techniques to capture the complex interactions between agricultural activities and water quality. Our findings will quantify the externalities of agricultural production on water resources and inform targeted interventions to mitigate nutrient pollution. This research addresses critical gaps in understanding the nexus between upstream nutrient runoff and downstream drinking water compliance, offering insights into the efficacy of current regulations and management strategies. The outcomes will be instrumental for policymakers seeking to enhance sustainable water management and protect public health.

                <p class="project-text">
                    This paper examines the effectiveness of Regional Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs) in improving rural and regional planning. RTPOs serve as a formalized platform for engaging local officials in non-metropolitan areas with populations under 50,000, integrating rural needs into the statewide transportation planning process. Established through the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21) Act, RTPOs were introduced to address the gaps in rural transportation planning by promoting a more cooperative, comprehensive, and continuing (3C) planning approach. Despite the significant geographic area represented by non-metropolitan regions, their transportation needs have historically been underrepresented. By providing a structured mechanism for rural stakeholders to collaborate and influence state transportation strategies, RTPOs aim to enhance planning efficiency and ensure equitable allocation of resources. This paper analyzes the role of RTPOs in fostering rural engagement and assesses their impact on transportation outcomes across different states. The findings will inform whether RTPOs are a viable model for advancing rural transportation planning and achieving balanced regional development.
